ppb is an education focused game engine. We focus on a gradual complexity ramp
that lets teachers and students focus only on the thing they want to.

Today, we'll be making a tiny breakout clone. (Demo)

First let's set up our environment, first, let's make a project directory and a
virtual environment.

1. create game-breakout folder.
2. in game-breakout create a virtual environment, use the requirements.txt
   provided
3. create a breakout.py file

The first step to any video game is to get a window going. Type the following.

```
import ppb


ppb.run()
```

If you run the file, you should see a window like this.

Any questions?
